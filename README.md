# To Do List API
Hello!
Welcome to my next project where i am exploring Java!
It's my first Java project where i am trying everything on hand and figuring out how everything works.

This is pretty basic project, i set several tasks for myself for this project:
1. Learn and explore Spring library üçÉ
2. Learn Maven and how building application in Java works
3. Teach myself to use Git and GitHub properly. As you can see i am getting myself comfortable to create and merge PR.
4. Added Dockerfile and docker-compose for easy set up.
5. Added static link "/" with all of the endpoints docs.

Things to do:
1. Authentication for the API, JWT.
2. ~~Put everything into Docker.~~

For the start you need to create and .env file inside the project and specify several things to start Docker file:
1. DB_USERNAME
2. DB_PASSWORD
3. DB_NAME
4. APP_PORT

If you want to run it without Docker, you need to specify full DB_URL inside .env

Thank you for checking out! Feel free to explore!

# To Do List API
Hello!
Welcome to my next project where i am exploring Java!
It's my first Java project where i am trying everything on hand and figuring out how everything works.

This is pretty basic project, i set several tasks for myself for this project:
1. Learn and explore Spring library üçÉ
2. Learn Maven and how building application in Java works
3. Teach myself to use Git and GitHub properly. As you can see i am getting myself comfortable to create and merge PR.

Things to do:
1. Authentication for the API, JWT.
2. Put everything into Docker.

Thank you for checking out! Feel free to explore!
